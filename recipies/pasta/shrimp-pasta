    white wine
    shrimp, in shell (I used 1/2 lb; about 2-3 servings)
    bacon
    shallot
    garlic
    pasta
    butter
    salt
    whole grain mustard
    pasta that you cooked while making this
      - hold some of the pasta liquid


 in a large mixing bowl, add salt, whole peppercorn, bay leaf, and herbage
 that you have on hand that works with shrimp. thyme is good.

 add the shrimp into the brine. Let sit for an hour or two. Let it be.

 peel the shrip, reserving the shell. Put the shrimp into a large mixing bowl.

 toss the shrimp with salt, ground pepper, cayenne, thyme, a spoon of whole
 grain mustard, and anything else that works with shrimp. make sure it's
 looking good.

 put bacon into a pan, medium high heat; work the bacon down to crispy,
 then pull the bacon, leave the bacon fat in the pan.

 add butter, shallot and garlic, work in the pan until translucent and
 delicious.

 run shallot and garlic through a strainer; hold aside. add any liquid that
 you pulled back into the pan.

 add in a healthy chunk of white wine and more butter. add in more herbage
 and the shrimp shells. Reduce heat to medium / medium low and let that
 reduce on its own. It winds up being a bit loose, but workable.

 put the reduced wine in the pan through a strainer, toss shells and herbage.

 return the liquid to the pan, add raw shrimp bacon, and shallot/garlic and
 cook through. If the mix gets too thick, add some of the pasta water for
 starchy goodness.

 add the pasta to the pan and toss. add a pat of butter.

 top with parm, or perhaps lemon.
